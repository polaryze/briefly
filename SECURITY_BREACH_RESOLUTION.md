# 🔒 SECURITY BREACH RESOLUTION

## 🚨 BREACH SUMMARY

**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Issue:** API keys exposed in frontend JavaScript files  
**Impact:** Attacker accessed personal information via OpenAI `/v1/user` endpoint  

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE

The API keys were stored in the local `.env` file and were being bundled into the frontend JavaScript files during the build process. This allowed anyone to view the source code and extract the keys.

**Exposed Keys:**
- OpenAI API Key: `[COMPROMISED - REMOVED]`
- RapidAPI Key: `[COMPROMISED - REMOVED]`

## ✅ RESOLUTION ACTIONS

### 1. **Immediate API Key Rotation**
- [ ] **ROTATE OPENAI API KEY** - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- [ ] **ROTATE RAPIDAPI KEY** - Go to https://rapidapi.com/
- [ ] **DELETE COMPROMISED KEYS** from both platforms

### 2. **Code Security Fixes**
- ✅ Removed API keys from `.env` file
- ✅ Cleared built JavaScript files (`dist/`)
- ✅ Rebuilt application without exposed secrets
- ✅ Verified new build contains no API keys
- ✅ Deployed secure version to production

### 3. **Architecture Improvements**
- ✅ All API calls moved to backend proxy endpoints
- ✅ No sensitive environment variables in frontend
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Input sanitization in place

## 🛡️ CURRENT SECURITY STATUS

### ✅ **SECURE**
- No API keys in frontend code
- No hardcoded secrets
- All sensitive operations on backend
- Proper environment variable separation
- Security headers implemented

### 🔒 **PROTECTION MEASURES**
- **Frontend:** Only non-sensitive environment variables
- **Backend:** All API keys stored securely
- **Build Process:** No secrets bundled into JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Clean builds without exposed data

## 🚨 **CRITICAL NEXT STEPS**

### **IMMEDIATE (DO NOW)**
1. **Rotate OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Delete the compromised key
   - Generate a new API key
   - Update your server environment variables

2. **Rotate RapidAPI Key**
   - Go to https://rapidapi.com/
   - Regenerate your API key
   - Update your server environment variables

3. **Check Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure no `VITE_*` variables contain API keys
   - Only server-side variables should contain secrets

### **VERIFICATION**
- ✅ New build contains no API keys
- ✅ Frontend code is clean
- ✅ Backend proxy endpoints working
- ✅ Security headers implemented

## 📋 **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES GUIDE**

### **FRONTEND (VITE_*) - SAFE**
```
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
VITE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=your-domain
```

### **BACKEND (SERVER-SIDE) - SECURE**
```
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-key
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-openai-key
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-new-rapidapi-key
```

## 🔍 **SECURITY AUDIT RESULTS**

### **BEFORE FIX**
- ❌ API keys in frontend JavaScript
- ❌ Hardcoded secrets in build files
- ❌ Environment variables exposed
- ❌ Attacker could access personal data

### **AFTER FIX**
- ✅ No API keys in frontend
- ✅ Clean build process
- ✅ Secure environment separation
- ✅ Backend-only API access
- ✅ Security headers implemented

## 🎯 **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Never store API keys in frontend environment variables**
2. **Always use backend proxy endpoints for sensitive operations**
3. **Regular security audits of built files**
4. **Immediate rotation of compromised keys**
5. **Proper environment variable separation**
